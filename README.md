# VILS

This little script enables you to ``edit an ls'', i.e. it will load a list of
filenames into your favourite editor (presumably vi). Any changes to the
filenames will result in renaming the respective files.

Originally from http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/scripts/Generic-utilities/ but the
original source has gone. This incarnation uses POSIX shell.
